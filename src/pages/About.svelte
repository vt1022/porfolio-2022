            I am a developer with design experience. My experience has taught me the value of reusability, user experience, and
            accessibility from both a development and design perspective. I love finding solutions that balance these concepts. I
            currently work daily with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, Git, Webpack, HTML and SASS. I am also currently
            learning other new technologies such as Svelte.
